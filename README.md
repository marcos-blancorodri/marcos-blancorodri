# Hi there, I'm Marcos 👋

I am a Computer Engineering student who enjoys solving the puzzle more than just writing the syntax.

Currently finishing my degree at Universitat Jaume I, I have built a strong technical core in Backend Development and Software Engineering. I pride myself on being resourceful: give me a project, and I will research, architect, and implement the solution.

While I can build robust applications, my true passion lies in understanding how systems work under the hood. I am actively pivoting my focus towards the infrastructure that supports modern software: Cloud Architecture, DevOps, and Security.

In my free time, I move away from traditional coding to focus on "the big picture": containerizing apps, understanding network protocols, exploring AI integration, and testing system security on platforms like HackTheBox.
